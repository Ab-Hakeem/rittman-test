### Rittman Analytics - Stackoverflow Trial

Rittman Analytics has tasked us with finding out what are the most popular and trending questions on Stackoverflow that are not being answered. The purpose of this task is to investigate this public dataset and gain a measure of intelligence from the data. The outcome of this task should direct us in finding an area in which there may be  an opportunity for potential subject matter experts to provide those answers.
